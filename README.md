# HackMyHat
Once upon a time you could hack my grad cap through my website! I've since chenged a lot about my website including changing the hosting service and removing this old project. 

Here is a picture of my hat at my graduation from ASU several years ago.

Users could go to the website, "sign my year book", and change the color of the screen. 

Originally, users were able to change the text on the screen too, but small scale tests (in classes, at sporting events etc) this proved to invite a ton of super awful stuff being written on my hat! I set up what I could to keep out the vitriol, but it wasn't enough-- thus the "hackable" text portion was removed. Now, as a former employee of Spectrum Labs, and a seasoned vet of the Trust and Saftey space I can understand just how hard the challenge of moderation really is.

The simple set up was available both on mobile and web. If you were not in attendance at the ASU graduation you could still enjoy being redirected to the page that changed color (which was what my hat was broadcasting).

At my last check-in in early 2023, the hat had over 2,500 "hacks" :)
